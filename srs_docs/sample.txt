Software Requirements Document (SRD)
1. Introduction
This document outlines the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the Dashboard Application, focusing on key functionalities such as Leave Management System (LMS) and Pods. The goal is to provide a clear reference for autonomous coding and implementation of the required features.
2. Overall Description
The Dashboard Application serves as a centralized interface for employees and managers to access various features, including:
•	Applying for and managing leaves
•	Viewing and managing Pods
•	Dashboard displaying multiple tiles summarizing key application highlights.
The DNA ecosystem consists of multiple microservices designed to streamline enterprise operations. Each service is developed using a modern technology stack:
•	Backend: FastAPI (Python, Pydantic for validation, SQLAlchemy for database interaction)
•	Database: PostgreSQL
•	Communication: REST APIs with WebSockets for real-time interactions
•	Deployment: Cloud-based, containerized architecture using Docker and Kubernetes
Each microservice follows a modular and scalable design, supporting CRUD operations, authentication, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and asynchronous operations.
3. Customers
The primary users of this system include:
•	General Users: Employees utilizing LMS and PODs Features.
•	Managers: Supervisory roles with permissions for approval workflows.
4. Functionality
Each microservice/application provides distinct capabilities:
Dashboard
•	Displays multiple tiles representing key insights from different applications.
•	Supports real-time data updates and drill-down interactions.
•	Allows configuration of displayed widgets based on user roles.
API Endpoints
Fetch Dashboard Data
Request:
GET /api/dashboard/tiles
Headers: { Authorization: Bearer <token> }
Response:
{
  "tiles": [
    { "id": "1", "title": "Leave Summary", "content": "10 leaves remaining" },
    { "id": "2", "title": "Pod Members", "content": "3 active members" }
  ]
}

LMS (Leave Management System)
•	General User: 
o	Submit leave requests with category selection (e.g., paid leave, sick leave, etc.).
o	View granted and pending leave requests.
o	Track available leave balances.
•	Manager: 
o	Approve or reject leave requests with comments.
o	Access reports of team leave history.
•	APIs & Endpoints: 
o	POST /leave/apply - Apply for leave.
o	GET /leave/status - Retrieve leave status.
o	PATCH /leave/approve/{id} - Approve/reject leave (Manager only).
API Endpoints
Apply for Leave

  "end_date": "2025-03-18",
  "reason": "Family event"
}
Response:
{
  "message": "Leave request submitted successfully",
  "status": "pending"
}
Approve Leave (Manager Only)
Request:
PATCH /api/lms/leaves/{leave_id}/approve
Headers: { Authorization: Bearer <token> }
Body:
{
  "status": "approved"
}

}

PODs (Project Oriented Development)
•	Manager: 
o	Assign employees to specific pods.
•	Employee: 
o	View assigned pod.
o	Recommend colleagues for inclusion.
•	APIs & Endpoints: 
o	POST /pods/assign - Assign employee to pod.
o	GET /pods/members - Retrieve pod members.
o	POST /pods/recommend - Recommend employees for pods.

7. User Class and Characteristics
•	Ensure RBAC, 
o	 Manager can access both manager and employee related APIs 
o	While, user can only access user specific APIs .
8. System Features and Requirements
Functional Requirements
•	Secure authentication and RBAC implementation.
•	Asynchronous API calls for background operations.
•	CRUD operations for core entities across all services.
•	Dashboard with real-time insights and analytics.
Non-Functional Requirements
•	Scalability: Support for high user concurrency and horizontal scaling.
•	Security: End-to-end encryption, data validation, and API rate-limiting.
•	Performance: API response times below 300ms.
•	Availability: 99.9% uptime with automated failover mechanisms.
•	Logging & Monitoring: Centralized logging with alert-based anomaly detection.
9. Common Mistakes to Avoid
•	Ambiguous Requirements: Clearly define workflows and API contracts.
•	Overcomplicated Workflows: Ensure ease of use and minimal user friction.
•	Ignoring Performance Optimization: Optimize queries, indexing, and caching.
•	Lack of Security Measures: Enforce RBAC, data encryption, and secure API access.
•	Inadequate Testing: Implement comprehensive unit and integration testing.
